					THE QUESTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ON ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT
				</h1>
				<h2 class="blog-head">ABSTRACT</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Israel-Palestine conflict, marked by controversy and bloodshed,
					holds significant interest for international legal scholars worldwide.
					It encompasses various elements of international law, ranging from
					statehood to international humanitarian law. The domains of
					international law covered by the conflict extend beyond a mere
					dispute, as it is intricately linked with historical, political, and
					socio-cultural factors. Therefore, it is essential to explore the
					various questions of international law raised by the conflict, along
					with the role of various international instruments that shape the
					concept of 'International Comity.' This exploration ultimately focuses
					on statehood as an abstract yet complex subject in the domain of
					Public International Law.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Israel-Palestine conflict has been a long-standing issue since the
					dawn of the modern International Regime, generating immense interest
					from various Human Rights groups. Its roots can be traced back to the
					British Mandate for Palestine and the Balfour Declaration, where both
					belligerents were promised the formulation of their independent
					states. The drive for Israeli independence was further intensified by
					the 'Zionism' movement in the aftermath of World War II. It wasn't
					until the 1948 UN partition plan that the two-state solution was
					implemented to address the prolonged conflict, leading to the Israeli
					War of Independence and subsequent wars. This ongoing saga of wars and
					conflicts on a socio-religious level raised various questions for the
					international community.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">
					SETTLEMENTS IN THE WEST BANK AND EAST JERUSALEM
				</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					One of the most contentious issues in the Israel-Palestine conflict is
					the construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank
					and East Jerusalem. Many consider these settlements a violation of
					international law, particularly under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
					Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that the transfer of
					an occupying power's civilian population into the territory it
					occupies is a breach of the convention. Even the ICJ Advisory Opinion
					on Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
					Palestinian Territory found the construction of the separation barrier
					in the West Bank to be in violation of international law. United
					Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) and Resolution 338
					(1973) emphasize the inadmissibility of acquiring territory by force
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">GAZA BLOCKADE</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, in place since 2007, has been
					criticized as a violation of international law. Critics argue that the
					blockade restricts the movement of people and goods, leading to
					humanitarian crises. The United Nations Human Rights Council has
					issued reports and resolutions condemning the blockade as a violation
					of international law. The Palmer Report (2011), which examined the
					Gaza flotilla incident, found the blockade to be legal but called for
					its "easing." United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948)
					asserts the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">QUESTION OF STATEHOOD</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					Two main theories of statehood exist: the declaratory theory and the
					constitutive theory. The declaratory theory suggests that an entity
					can attain statehood simply by declaring it. Certain principles that
					may apply to the theory can be found in various ICJ advisory opinions.
					For example, the ICJ Advisory opinion on Kosovo mentions that
					principles of international relations are essentially limited to the
					sphere of 'International relations.' Thus, one cannot expect
					compliance with International Humanitarian Law from organizations like
					the PLO and Hamas, which are abstract entities by nature. The
					constitutive theory of statehood mandates four criteria, as outlined
					in the Montevideo Convention, for attainment. The UN partition plan
					manifested the two-state solution, something also applied to the
					Indian subcontinent. Through this UN resolution, Israel declared its
					independence, which led to the first war. However, it's worth noting
					that even though Israel welcomed this resolution, the Arab world
					rejected it. Therefore, it would be challenging for the PLO to
					establish the existence of a Palestinian state, implying the
					fulfillment of such criteria under the convention. Thus, Palestine's
					statehood remains a distant prospect, considering the Advisory Opinion
					on Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied
					Palestinian Territory. The ICJ, while treating Israel as an occupier,
					attempted to enforce the general principles of laws concerning the
					occupation of a hostile power in international law, primarily outlined
					in the 1907 Hague Regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention, as
					well as in specific provisions of Additional Protocol I and customary
					international law. However, following the constitutive theory of
					statehood, Palestine and the Arab world, which had rejected the UN
					partition plan, lack the right to claim Palestine as a state. Thus,
					without statehood, Palestine cannot assert claims of sovereignty and
					territorial integrity, which are typically matters for international
					relations between states, as reiterated in the ICJ's Advisory Opinion
					on Kosovo.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Israel-Palestine conflict is a deeply entrenched and multifaceted
					issue with numerous legal dimensions. Violations of international law
					in the conflict remain subjects of ongoing debate and contention. Key
					areas of concern include Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East
					Jerusalem, the Gaza blockade, the use of force, the rights of
					Palestinian refugees, and questions regarding the recognition and
					statehood of Palestine. While international bodies such as the United
					Nations, the International Court of Justice, and human rights
					organizations have issued various resolutions and opinions, these
					matters remain highly contested. The loss of life and dignity, coupled
					with the growing divide between the people fueled by hatred, is a
					matter of great concern that can only be resolved when the fundamental
					elements of this conflict, mainly involving the political and
					religious enforcement of ideologies, are brought to an end. In
					contemporary times, institutions like the Oslo and the Abraham Accords
					are attempting to mitigate the deteriorating situation between the two
					parties. However, external factors, primarily the religious conflict,
					draw the attention of the world to this conflict, which must be
					addressed with consensus. Without this, an appropriate resolution to
					this conflict remains elusive.
