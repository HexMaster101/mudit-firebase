					UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF SEA AND DISPUTES REVOLVING
					AROUND SOUTH CHINA SEA
				</h1>
				<h2 class="blog-head">ABSTRACT</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The South China Sea has been one of the most discussed geographical
					region post WW2 geopolitical scenario. China’s imperialistic ambitions
					in the region have hamstrung the interest of South East Asian nations
					leaving them impuissant. The following dispute in the South China Sea
					revolves around the regions economic value lying in its rich fisheries
					, crude oil and natural gas importance which entices the European
					Union , The United States Of America and India.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">KEYWORDS</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					UNCLOS, Imperialism, Permanent court of arbitration, Salami Slicing,
					Cabbage Wrapping, FONOP (Freedom of navigation operations).
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The sea lies in the south of China hence it is known as South China
					Sea. The Indian Ocean is connected with South China sea through the
					Strait of Malacca, which is also known as the world’s busiest trade
					route. The South China sea is connected with the East China sea
					through the Farmosa Strait named after the ex-Taiwan (Farmosa Island)
					which lies in the middle of the strait. The countries which are
					involved in the South China sea dispute are namely Malaysia,
					Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam which stand against the claims of
					China. The basis of China lies in its historical texts. It blatantly
					refuses to recognise the UNCLOS and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
					which has made the region a disputed hotspot in geopolitics. The
					suspected crude oil and natural gas deposits have drawn the attention
					of western nations towards it. India has also been one of the most
					active players in the region since China became hostile and a close
					ally of Pakistan.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					This paper uses the doctrinal method of research and is structured
					upon secondary sources of information. It makes use of the various
					trade agreements, conventions and treaties. The paper also uses data
					from the official sources of involving governing bodies which are
					recognised internationally.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">REVIEW OF LITERATURE</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The only way to end the South China sea dispute is that China should
					abide to the UNCLOS and recognise the EEZ of the neighbouring nations.
					It should respect their economic interests and the resources which lie
					in their EEZ. Western nations and India should take strict stand on
					laws, globally and regionally. The only thing that ASEAN nations can
					do, should they really want to stand together against China, is to
					first focus on developing the individual countries’ economies and
					together gradually try to reduce their dependence on Chinese products,
					markets, and aid. ASEAN should reduce competition among its members,
					increase internal aid programs, and exchange technology and
					experiences. Only when each and every ASEAN nation is strong enough
					and really enjoys cooperation within the organization, can a common
					approach finally be considered. But in the age of a prosperous ASEAN,
					there would no longer be a need to raise this sensitive issue against
					China. Seeing ASEAN growing stronger economically will entice China to
					behave moderately — to cooperate rather than take the offensive in the
					South China Sea. This is the only peaceful solution to the conflict.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">CHINA’S ROAD TO ‘HISTORIC CLAIMS’</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					In May 2009, Chinese diplomats attached a map of U-shaped line to an
					official submission to the United Nations Convention on The Limits of
					Continental Shelf. It’s meaning as given by Dr.Wu Shieun was as
					follows:-
				</p>
				<ul style="margin-top: 32px">
					<li>Sovereignty over the features within this line</li>
					<li>
						Sovereignty of rights and jurisdiction over waters as defined by
						UNCLOS.
					</li>
					<li>
						Historic rights over fishing, navigation and resource developments.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The problem for the region and the world lies in the third point of
					the above document. China’s legal scholars are trying hard to justify
					China’s enjoyment of historic rights to waters upto 1500 kms away from
					the disputed Chinese territory. According the to pioneering work of a
					Canadian scholar, the U shaped line was never meant to justify China’s
					historic claims rather than it was a cartographic device used back
					then in 1946-47 to indicate which islands did China claimed and which
					it did not.<br /><br />
					Another, Christopher Chung, a PhD student at the University of
					Toronto, is the first person to forensically examine the archives of
					the official Republic of China (ROC) committee that drew the line. In
					the meeting between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the
					Interior, Ministry of National Defense, and ROC Navy General
					Headquarters, it was clearly laid down in the above that the U-shaped
					line and its meaning was clear to that ROC committee: it defined “the
					scope of what is to be received for the purpose of receiving each of
					the islands of the South China Sea”. The committee’s interest was only
					in the islands. They made no mention of waters, historic or
					otherwise.<br /><br />
					Nothing changed in China’s claims even after the Communist revolution
					in 1949. Chinese premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Treaty Of San
					Francisco 1931. He talked only of the islands not of waters. In 1958,
					‘the declaration o territorial sea’ claimed 12 nautical miles of
					territorial sea- explicitly mentioning that the islands were separated
					from the mainland by the high seas. Again, we find no mention of
					historic claims. China’s claims became vague in January 1974. Just
					before the battle of Paracels in which Chinese forces evicted
					Vietnamese forces from the western half of those islands and on
					January 12, people’s daily declared that ‘The resources of these
					islands and their adjacent seas belonged entirely to China.’ This was
					not a historic claim either, rather than it was the first sign that
					China understood the implications of the negotiations of UNCLOS. Which
					began an year before and claims that maritime resources would be
					measured from the coast and the islands.<br /><br />
					The PRC participated in all the negotiations that were held till 1982.
					The final texts of the UNCLOS to which everyone agreed including China
					was that to make no mention of ‘Historic’ rights. China ratified the
					convention in 1996. So, the ROC government didn’t claim “historic
					rights” in the South China Sea in 1946-8 and neither did the PRC in
					its 1958 decree, its 1974 statement, at the UNCLOS negotiations, or
					subsequently in its 1992 Law concerning Territorial Waters and
					Adjacent Regions. However something changed in the late 1990’s
					however. By the time when PRC passed it’s law on EEZ and the
					continental shelf in 1998. The officials felt it necessary to include
					that the ‘provisons of this law shall not affect the historic rights
					enjoyed by the PRC’. The term historic rights only entered the Chinese
					lexicon in the late 1990’s.<br /><br />
					The events that gave rise to such a situation are evidently the active
					persuasion by a American oil company named Crestone which was owned by
					and individual, Randall C Thompson. He signed a deal with Philippines
					that open his eyes to the potential riches of the South China Sea. His
					engineers advised him that next big play would become around the
					Spratley islands.<br /><br />
					In April 1991, Thompson travelled to South China Sea Institute of
					oceanography, Guangzhou. There he discovered the richness of resources
					lying in the South East of Vietnam. Since then he started to persuade
					higher Chinese authorities with the help of Daniel J. Dzurek, the
					former chief of boundary division of US department of State. Thompson
					kept trying to persuade the Chinese to take Crestone seriously until,
					in February 1992, after much deliberation at the highest levels in
					Beijing, he finally got to pitch his proposal to the board of the
					China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC). Thompson took along a
					legal advisor to precisely define the patch of seabed he wanted the
					rights to. He seems to have accepted – and developed – the idea that
					China had “historic rights” in the area beyond those spelled out in
					UNCLOS. Since then PRC, translated the U shaped line into traditional
					sea boundary line.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">WHAT ARE 9 DASH LINE AND 11 DASH LINE?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					In the year 1947, the PRC introduced the 11 dash line, an unofficial
					map was released and whole South China Sea was declared a part of it,
					to mark the area of extent the geographer made the use of 11 dash
					line. With 11 dashes at the time, it encompassed most of the South
					China Sea. The Chinese communist party adopted the map in 1949, but
					removed two dashes to give Gulf Of Tonkin to Vietnam as a courtesy,
					Within the dashes were key archipelagos- including Spratly and Paracel
					islands-and various other features, including a set of coral reefs
					near the Philippines.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">WHY IS CHINA BUILDING ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					China is building artificial islands to find an alternate method which
					is recognisable by international law according to it. China now claims
					the extent of area lying within its EEZ by measuring 200 nautical
					miles from those artificial islands. Moreover it is claimed by China
					that these islands are not artificially created but were already a
					part of China since beginning but were submerged due to high seas.
					Under UNCLOS, such artificial islands don’t have any maritime rights,
					and nor do submerged reefs. China has built an island with a runway
					for fighter jets, a hospital with its own garden, and even a farm with
					about 500 animals. This kind of action is also prompting environmental
					damage while it is giving China a base for air and sea patrols.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">HOW IS VIETNAM COUNTERING CHINA?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					In order to sustain Indian presence in the hydrocarbon-rich South
					China Sea, Vietnam has decided to extend the contract for exploration
					of oil and gas resources in a significant oil block in the region
					to ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL). India is also using it as a juncture to
					checkmate China in the chess table of geopolitics. China is working
					closely with India’s oldest rival, Pakistan on the CPEC (China
					Pakistan Economic Corridor) and the following project passes through
					the PoK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) which is a disputed territory.
					China’s development in the region directly trespasses with India’s
					internal affairs and it is an indication that China recognises
					Pakistan as the rightful owner of the disputed territory.<br /><br />As
					Vietnam gave Indian companies the contract to extract natural gas and
					oil reserves, in return India has given a $50 million defence credit
					line to Vietnam to purchase military hardware from India to safeguard
					it coasts against Chinese territories.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">HISTORY OF VIETNAM AND GENEVA ACCORD OF 1954</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The decision to invade Vietnam was made by Napoleon III in July 1857.
					It was the result not only of missionary propaganda but also, after
					1850, of the upsurge of French capitalism, which generated the need
					for overseas markets and the desire for a larger French share of the
					Asian territories conquered by the West. The military of the then
					imperialistic Japan invaded the French controlled Vietnam in September
					1940 and remained there until the end of WW2 (1945 August).<br /><br />Japan
					occupies, annexes and renames the Spratly Islands "Shinnan Shoto "(New
					Southern Islands) on 30th March 1939 and places them under the
					Governor-General of Formosa. Later, the IJN establishes a seaplane
					base and a submarine base at Itu Aba (Nagashima -"Long Island") the
					largest of the Spratly Islands.  On 4th April 1939, Japanese troops
					invade the Paracels. Japan claims the islands were Chinese territory
					and that Japan is at war with China. Japan then declares the islands
					as a Japanese Protectorate. Till the end of WW2 which ended after USA
					nuked Japan, it constantly used these two islands for constant
					tactical operations in the region.<br /><br />Japan was made to sign
					the Treaty Of San Francisco in 1951 in which it had to relinquish its
					control from both the islands. Although it must be noted that the
					treaty did not specify the new status of these islands. The ASEAN
					nations were busy in doing negotiations while China made various
					claims on these islands during the 1951 treaty.<br /><br />The
					deciding factor was the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, where the
					French were decisively defeated. This resulted in French withdrawals,
					and the Geneva conference. It was decided that Vietnam would be
					divided at the 17th parallel until 1956, when democratic elections
					would be held under international supervision. After the division of
					North and South Vietnam, The Paracels and Spratley islands became a
					part of South Vietnam as it was a part of it’s EEZ. However, two years
					later North Vietnam claimed that these two islands historically
					belongs to PRC.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">VIGILATION BY INTERNATIONAL LAW AND UNCLOS</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Hague based Permanent Court of Arbitration in it’s ruling of
					October 29th, 2015) said that it has jurisdiction over case filed by
					Philippines, which contests against China’s claims to nearly 90% of
					the South China Sea. In response to the aforementioned PCA’s decision,
					on October 30, 2015, China released the Statement of the Ministry of
					Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China in which it
					mentioned that China will disregard any findings by the PCA on the
					case brought by the Philippines, saying it is “null and void, and has
					no binding effect on China. China has its own depositions but the
					statement has no basis in international law.<br /><br />
					China’s denial of PCA’s jurisdiction over the matter is clear
					ignorance od Article 288(4) UNCLOS which reads as: “In the event of a
					dispute as to whether a court or tribunal has jurisdiction, the matter
					shall be settled by decision of that court or tribunal.” Its worth to
					mention the Southern Bluefin Tuna Case, in which Australia and New
					Zealand’s response to the UNCLOS Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, in which
					it was stressed that: “These provisions [Part XV of UNCLOS –
					Settlement of Disputes] clearly imply that a tribunal exercising
					jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction under Article 288(4) of
					UNCLOS should lean in favour of the effectiveness and comprehensive
					character of the dispute settlement regime, itself a key aspect of the
					UNCLOS regime. It should not accept arguments which would minimise the
					effectiveness of Part XV, lending themselves to easy evasion of its
					provisions.”<br /><br />It must be highlighted that both Philippines
					and China are signatories to the UNCLOS, Philippines ratified the
					UNCLOS on May 8, 1984 and China on June 7, 1996. According to the
					Article 287 of the UNCLOS: When there is a dispute arising, both
					parties must consent to the same procedure for settlement of dispute.
					However, if there is no agreement on procedures, then the dispute must
					go to binding arbitration. The arbitration’s award shall be final and
					without appeal, which shall be complied with by the parties to the
					dispute. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties contains
					this rule in Article 26 which provides that “every treaty in force is
					binding on the parties to it and must be performed by them in good
					faith.”<br /><br />According to the Article 9 of the Annex VII to the
					UNCLOS expressly addresses the situation in which if one of the
					members to the dispute refuses to take part in the arbitration process
					then the failure by a party to defend it’s case shall not bar the
					proceedings. Which means that China is a part to arbitration and
					pursuant to the provisions of Article 296(1) UNCLOS and Article 11 of
					Annex VII and is bound by all the awards given by the tribunal.

					INVLOVEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE REGION
				</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					After America’s victory in the WW2 it decided to take its’s presence
					to each hotspot in the world. In the game of geopolitics, a superpower
					is considered to be that nation which has the most dominant position
					on world sea route. South China Sea which is the gateway to one-third
					of the world’s shipment which is approximately $3 trillion trade each
					year. Now, evidently it was very essential for U.S.A to hold it’s
					presence is South China Sea and establish close ties with countries of
					ASEAN.<br /><br />America decided to establish it’s military presence
					in the region and gave the security assurance to all the ASEAN and
					South East Asian nations, in return ASEAN nations focused more on
					human resource, education, health and public welfare, which helped
					their economies and standard of living grow, the investments which
					would otherwise go in a large portion of defence expenditure to defend
					themselves against China. Today, USA hold permanent military presence
					in Japan, South Korea and Philippines. It also conducts regular naval
					exercises along with these nations to show muscle power to China. “The
					United States stands with our ally, the Philippines, in upholding the
					rules-based international order and freedom of navigation in the South
					China Sea, as guaranteed under international law”: A recent press
					report from the US Department of State said. Article 5 commits the
					United States to defend Japan if it is attacked by a third party.
					Article 6 explicitly grants the United States the right to base troops
					on Japanese soil, subject to a detailed "Administrative Agreement"
					negotiated separately. America’s geopolitical and economic interests
					in the region are evident as in the year 2017 alone, America spent
					massive $328.8 billion to secure it’s presence in the region.<br /><br />
					<span style="font-weight: 700"
						>What is the meaning of the term ‘Salami Slicing’ </span
					>The term ‘Salami Slicing’ refers to China’s barbaric and expansionist
					actions which helps it to acquire new territories in small fractions
					and ultimately dominate the region, for example, China trespasses the
					Galwan Valley which is originally the part of India and as a peace
					gesture it would ask for the exchange of old occupied territory for a
					new territory, despite the fact that both the territories belong to
					the other nation. China first stakes claim on a territory and keeps
					repeating its claim at all platforms and on all possible occasions. It
					launches a propaganda disputing the claim of the other party to such
					an extent that the territory in question is recognised as a dispute
					between China and the other country. In resolving the dispute, China
					uses its military and diplomatic might to gain a part of it.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">SUGGESTIONS</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					China’s ambitions would stop only if the world collectively takes a
					stand against China. India should formulate a specific military sight
					on Indo Pacific and South China Sea. India should form close military
					ties with ASEAN nations and become an active exporter of military
					hardware it has recently developed like LCA Tejas and BRAHMOS Cruise
					Missile. QUAD and AUKUS should explicitly define its military
					ambitions rather than working diplomatically in the name of trade,
					pandemic support and environment treaties. America should strongly
					take stand against China in support of Taiwan otherwise the world can
					witness a mirror situation of what Russia did in Ukraine and what
					China will do to Taiwan.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">CONCLUSION</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The South China Sea is considered to be one of the most important
					global hotspots of the 21st Century. China should uphold international
					law and the UNCLOS guidelines to which it is a signatory, it should
					respect the economic ambitions of neighbouring nations which heavily
					depend upon waterways. The United Nations should uphold it’s
					responsibility and should condemn China in case it tries to trespass
					collective interests of other nations.
